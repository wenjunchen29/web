Myriad opportunities exist for getting involved in SoBA Lab research, whether for a short stint or a longer term engagement. We are a diverse, fun, and energetic bunch, who welcome all comers to join in the social neuroscience and social robotics party! Opportunities to get involved in the SoBA Lab include, but are not limited to:


Have you ever wondered how you can <span style="color:green">*recognize someone’s voice**</span> even if you don’t see their face? How do you know who is speaking when you listen to a podcast or a phone call? How can machines do the same thing? These are some of the questions that speaker identification tries to answer. Speaker identification is the task of determining who is speaking in an audio clip by using voice biometry. It is based on the idea that each speaker has unique voice characteristics that can be extracted and compared with a set of enrolled speaker profiles. Speaker identification can be useful for various applications, such as remote meeting productivity, multiuser device personalization, and forensic analysis. In this website, I will introduce some of the methods and challenges of speaker identification, and refer to some journal papers on this topic, such as [Perrachione et al. (2011)](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1207327), who showed that human voice recognition depends on language ability1.
