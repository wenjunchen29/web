<h2 id="vocal-confidence"><font size="5"><span style="color:blue">Vocal Confidence</span></font></h2>

Vocal confidence is a skill that we need to communicate effectively and persuasively in various situations. It involves using our voice to express our ideas with clarity, authority and emotion and to influence how others perceive us and respond to us. Our vocal confidence can be affected by different factors, such as our tone of voice, our speech rate, our pauses and our pitch. 
<br><br>Depending on how we use these vocal cues, we can sound confident, doubtful or neutral when we speak (or more). A confident tone of voice is accompanied by increased speech rate and loudness, short and infrequent pauses, and sometimes, higher pitch. These vocal cues can signal that the speaker is certain, assertive and trustworthy. On the other hand, a doubtful tone of voice may have a lower speech rate and loudness, long and frequent pauses, and lower pitch. These vocal cues can signal that the speaker is uncertain, hesitant and untrustworthy. A neutral tone of voice may have a moderate speech rate and loudness, normal pauses, and average pitch. These vocal cues can signal that the speaker is calm, objective and indifferent.
