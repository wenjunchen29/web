 **<font size="5"><span style="color:blue">Interested in joining the SoBA Lab?</span></font>**

Myriad opportunities exist for getting involved in SoBA Lab research, whether for a short stint or a longer term engagement. We are a diverse, fun, and energetic bunch, who welcome all comers to join in the social neuroscience and social robotics party! Opportunities to get involved in the SoBA Lab include, but are not limited to:

<span style="color:green">**Volunteer internships**</span> for students from any country of the world. Past SoBA interns have come many different countries, including Germany, Austria, the USA, Czech Republic, UK, France, and Japan. If you are interested in applying for a volunteer internship in the the SoBA Lab, please download [this form](https://www.soba-lab.com/_files/ugd/3e5863_30af3bfba5784e72b3f1d2bec0cfe069.docx), follow all instructions, and return the completed application form (including current CV) as one pdf document to the SoBA Lab Office Manager, [Claudia Boschung](claudia.boschung@gess.ethz.ch). Please also contact Claudia with any further procedural questions.

<span style="color:red">**Undergrad final year projects**</span> under the supervision of Dr. Ramsey or Prof. Cross are frequently available for interested students in the lab. You will also have the opportunity to work closely with PhD/postdoc scholars in the lab and gain a rich, hands-on research experience.

<span style="color:teal">**Postdoctoral fellowships**</span> will be advertised here and on the lab home page when available. We are always happy to support outstanding final stage PhD students or postdoctoral scholars whose research interests align with the lab in applying for competitive postdoc fellowship funding schemes.  such applications from excellent candidates. A number of funding bodies offer competitive fellowships for postdocs coming from anywhere in the world, including the Swiss National Science Foundation, EU/Marie Curie fellowships, and the DAAD and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (for postdocs coming from Germany/of German nationality)

 

A POSTDOC is available with Rich - social and cognitive neuroscience, plus all things open science. advert

<span style="color:aqua">**Fulbright fellowships**</span> for talented American graduates who wish to undertake research/complete a masters degree in Sydney are available, and the SoBA Lab is happy to support applications for such fellowships.

<span style="color:fuchsia">**Part-time paid RA work**</span> is not currently available for social neuroscience research, but will be advertised here when available. Currently, we ARE looking for someone to redesign/overhaul our website and get it off Wix and onto something with better version control and editability. If you have the skills to pay the bills, and would like to work with us on this project, please get in touch!


<span style="color:maroon">**PhD positions**</span> - Dr. Ramsey is currently recruiting a new PhD student for a September/October 2023 start, At the moment, Prof. Cross is prioritising recruiting interested students through the Joint Doctoral Program on Learning Sciences ([JDPLS](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/jdpls-learning-sciences/)), a collaborative program between ETHZ and EPFL.

 

NOT CURRENTLY RUNNING:
<span style="color:navy">**SNAC meetings**</span> are social neuroscience seminars formerly organised within the School of Psychology at Bangor, and are soon to start up at Macquarie. Everyone is welcome so please come along if you're interested - [see here for details](https://www.soba-lab.com/snac-meetings)


<span style="color:purple">**So-bots Journal Club**</span> - [see here for details](http://www.so-bots.com/journal-club/)

The goal of the Social Robots Journal Club is to discuss recent articles in the field of human-robot interaction (HRI). We will read and dissect papers from a wide range of HRI topics, from the perception of artificial agents, to the beliefs and experiences of human agents, to (non)shared neural representation mediating interaction with our robotic friends and much more.
